# hmic/hmicp

note: i am just an kid and made the first type of HMIC in school with an 3x3 display and my freind had no idea what the hell i was talking about (and yes i did it like this

display= 3x3
F1{
rgb(0,0,0){
PL=whateverxwhatever-whateverxwhatever
P=whateverxwhatever
  }
}
this right here was the erlyest prtotype made on paper
and then i used python with pygame but it was an snail
then i use c++ and then used opengl but too hard so then i used just SDL2 then regex was horrible so i made my own (HMICX - hatsune miku is cringe regeX) 
and now with HMICP i dont know how the hell it works i just asked ai to make it prerenderd 
and yes i made it in ai do not exspect an 13 year old boy to even understand making an codec at this age
note: check the test folders as you can see more efficent formats like HMICP and HMICP7 (hatsune miku is cringe prerenderd)
(7 is inspierd by 7-zip)
warning: hmicmp4 is very buggy and this wil be abandoned since it is was to hard but you can use HMIC tech as an lossless GIF or PNG 
note: HMICA (hatsune miku is cringe audio) wil be added soon and current its not made 
!: please do not send me porn or NSFW or NSFL etc to me with the HMIC format if you do well then i wil hate you
i: if you find bugs, congrats i wil then say to you "fix it on you're own" fix it my self OR (100% chanse) ask ai to fix it (i am too smart)
note: shoutout to whoever made the miku art in the github repo and shoutout for google for making serching the imiage possible
note: there are miku imiages everywhere to test whatever-> HMIC i didnt make them
